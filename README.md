# wordlescraper

Initially intended to be a wordle web scraper - i'm now just using the Twitter API (and tweepy) and Google Sheets APIs (credit to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nl_kSpnsmY-qvez2OHvMmtIYfM7tZhP5embgmedMRxE/edit#gid=556946757) for keeping their sheet up to date)
to pull in Wordle Statistics and distribution data that are being aggregated by @wordlestats.

I have also pulled in a list of all possible [5 letter wordle words](https://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list/blob/main/words)

Next step will be to attempt to make a link between the difficulty of the word (as measured by the Average # of guesses for that day). Also could check # of reports back - is it seasonal? is it growing or shrinking over time, is it more or fewer on the weekends? Also - it's possible if it's a hard day that fewer will tweet about it? look for some hypothesis testing
